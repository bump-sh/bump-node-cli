## Installation

TODO

- publish npm package on https://www.npmjs.com/ (`npm publish`)
- Write CI which will package the cli in a standalone tarball and publish it to Github Releases
  - See oclif documentation with [`oclif-dev pack`](https://oclif.io/docs/releasing#standalone-tarballs) to package the CLI with an embedded node binary
  - There are three other tasks `oclif-dev <pack:win|pack:macos|pack:deb>` available which seem to be able to package tarballs comptible with Windows, macOS, Debian/Ubuntu respectively

- Go even further and package binaries into package repositories:
  - [Example Homebrew formula](https://github.com/heroku/homebrew-brew/blob/master/Formula/heroku.rb#L9) to distribute package with `brew`
  - Example distribution compatible with `apt` package manager by using a plain S3-like bucket from the [oclif documentation](https://oclif.io/docs/releasing#ubuntudebian-packages)
  - Docker container
  - Nix derivation
  - Snap ?
  - …
